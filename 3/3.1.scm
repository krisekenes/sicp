; Exercise 3.1. An accumulator is a procedure that is called repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum. Each time it is called, it returns the currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure make-accumulator that generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. The input to make-accumulator should specify the initial value of the sum; for example

(define (make-accumulator sum)
  (lambda (x) 
    (begin (set! sum (+ sum x)) sum)))
